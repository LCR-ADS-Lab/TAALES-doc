## Psycholinguistic Norms

### Definition
Psycholinguistic norms refer to word-level properties such as concreteness, familiarity, imageability, and meaningfulness.

### Methodology
TAALES computes psycholinguistic scores by averaging normed ratings per word from psycholinguistic databases. Scores are calculated separately for all words (AW), content words (CW), and function words (FW), depending on the index.

### Corpus used
- MRC Psycholinguistic Database (Coltheart, 1981)
- Brysbaert Concreteness Norms (Brysbaert et al., 2013)
